Final:
will be including chapter 13 views, know code and concepts
from 12/4/2023 on you don't have to know code, just concepts

Chapter 13
Scripting

1. A script is a series of SQL statements that you can store in a file.
2. Each script can contain one or more batches that are execited as a unit.
3. To signal the end of a batch you use the GO command.
	a. GO command isn't required after the last batch in a script or for a script that contains a single batch.
	b. If a statement must be executed before the statements that follow can succeed, you should include a GO command after it.
4. the statements within a batch are executed in the order they appear in a batch.

statements that need their own batch: view, procedure, function, trigger, schema

Keywords you'd use in a script: 
USE - changes the database context 
PRINT - returns a message to the client (console)
DECLARE - declares a local variable
SET - sets the value of a local variable or a session variable
EXEC - execute a particular stored procedure that you already have or a SQL statement

Control the flow:
IF...ELSE
BEGIN...END - defines a statement block
WHILE
BREAK
CONTINUE
TRY...CATCH
GOTO - will make program go out of order
RETURN - will make program go out of order

Variables:
2 types - Scalar and Table
Scalar variable - contain a single value (declare and set)
Table variable - standard, view , temp , table, derived

Variable scope:
Scope - which code can access the variable
Local - only particular parts of the code
Global - all code
In a SQL script, a variable's scope is the batch in which it's defined.


For next week, think abou the acid principles and come up with what you think your trigger and stored procedure should be and step by step.
Trigger - someone returns a book, what happens, automatically with no user input
Stored Procedure - someone checks out a book, something that needs to be kicked off
